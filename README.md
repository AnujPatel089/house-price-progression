# 🏡 House Price Progression Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

A machine learning project to predict house prices using regression techniques and structured real estate data. This project demonstrates a full data science workflow — from loading and exploring the dataset, to feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📊 Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates the sale price of houses given various numerical and categorical input features such as area, quality, year built, and more. The model helps understand how different factors influence price trends and progression in housing markets. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Read datasets into dataframes  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand distributions and relationships  
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categories  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Create meaningful predictive features  
5. **Model Training** – Train regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
6. **Model Evaluation** – Use metrics like RMSE or R² score  
7. **Prediction & Saving Model** – Save the best-performing model
